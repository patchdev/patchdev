## Hello! I'm Diego, welcome to my profile:
I'm an electronic and automatic's engineer. I always enjoyed communities on internet, until 2011 when I decided to create my own community where I learned how to manage CMS, HTML and CSS. Two years later in 2013, some upgrades were needed, and dropped private servers to learn how to self-hosting, adquiring knowledge about LEMP stack, port forwading, remote conection through terminal, databases and more.
For the hardware path, since young I've been repairing my owns electronics and with some basics of hardware design and tools like KiCAD, I'm willing to create my own hardware in the future. Defensor of the "Right to repair" movement.
